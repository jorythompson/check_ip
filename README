Checks the external IP address of your router and emails you if it changes
This is useful if you access your dynamic IP network from outside of your (generally home) network.
I am running it on my ReadyNAS so it is minimumly intrusive.
It will create a file the first time it runs that holds the current IP address.
Whenever it runs again (instructons for setting up a chron is in the script) it checks the extern IP address and
compares it to the old one.
If it has changed, it will email you and update the current IP file.
